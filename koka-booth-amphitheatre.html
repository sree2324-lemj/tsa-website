      <p>Koka Booth Amphitheatre has been an iconic landmark for over 25 years. Each concert and performance created a community of culture. The Amphitheatre is an outdoor shed hosting some of the biggest touring shows in the country. Many National Actors, including Alison Krauss, Billy Strings, Chris Stapleton, Robert Plant, and Sheryl Crow, had performed under stars on this very stage.  </p>
      <p>Koka Booth Amphitheatre is a major outdoor performance venue in Cary. Originally, when this amphitheatre was built back in 2001, it was named The Amphitheatre at Regency Park. However, they renamed it to honor the former mayor, Koka Booth. The Amphitheatre brings a wide range of entertainment to Cary. The venue is known for its annual programming, including partnerships like the NC Symphony summerfest series and the Chinese lantern festivel.  </p>
