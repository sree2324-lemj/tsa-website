      <p>The Center for Volunteer Caregiving is a nonprofit organization in Cary focused on improving the lives of the elderly and disabled. The volunteers provide care to people whose family members need a much-needed break. Founded in 1992, it encourages people in the community to volunteer and help people who need it. Services are appointed at no charge to and include transportation, essential appointments, errands, grocery trips, while also including basic tasks like housework and chores.</p>
      <p>The Center for Volunteering and Caregiving helps hundreds of individuals each year. The Center allows senior citizens and disbaled to continue living in their homes instead of moving to institutional care. The services can also help provide stress relief and support for families not earning as much, as their services are completely free. Because of the demand for help, community and volunteer help are essential to making this organization's mission a reality. </p>
